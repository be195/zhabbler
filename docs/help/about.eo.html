<h1>
    Zhabbler is a social network.
</h1>
<p>
    A copy of Tumblr but more adequate (although there are bugs ahem...).
</p>
<p>
    Where you can share your art, your thoughts, and anything else you want!
</p>
<p>
    Where you can find new friends and acquaintances
</p>
<p>
    And if you think about it â€”
</p>
<h2 style="background: linear-gradient(to right,#ff0000, #ff9d00, #aaa700, #1eb400, #00b3ff, #1900ff, #b300ff);-webkit-background-clip: text;-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;">
    Zhabbler can be whatever you want it to be.
</h2>
<p>
    This is your space. Any content you make or find will be about you. Welcome home to the world of chaos! Make it your own.
